# Movies-ETL

***Purposes of the analysis :***
Britta needs  help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. 
I was using my skills in refactoring  the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

***Outcome :****

To help Britta , I created four technical analysis deliverables 
•	Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
•	Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
•	Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
•	Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database



Supported with screen shots and uploading all pics  to my Github 
For deliverable number one refactored the given code to generate clean  Wikimovies data frame  , Kaggle metadata frame and rating data frame 


For deliverable number two I did refactoring, extract and transform the Wikipedia data so you can merge it with the Kaggle metadata. While extracting the IMDb IDs using a regular expression string and dropping duplicates.

Deliverable number three I did the coding for refactoring, extract and transform the Kaggle metadata and Movie Lens rating data, then converted the transformed data into separate Data Frames. Then, merged the Kaggle metadata Data Frame with the Wikipedia movies Data Frame to create the movies  Finally, I merged the Movie Lens rating data Frame with the , movies data frame to create the movies with rating data frame .


Deliverable number 4 I did the refactoring and connecting to the pg Admin but run into an error and couldn’t commit to my Github repo , but after a challenging time I managed with the help of Learning team to do it , 


In this assignment I have had a very hard time with my git hub to commit and push my assignments as the csv files specially the Ratings file is too big to me pushed that’s took days from me to get solved between deliverable two , three and four .
